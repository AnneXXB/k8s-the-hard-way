# Kubernetes - The Hard Way

This tutorial will help you to set up Kubernetes clusters, in the hard way, and it provides in-depth introduction and instructions allowing to to get inside the entire system. This guide is not for people looking for a fully automated command to create a Kubernetes cluster. If that's you then check out [Google Container Engine](https://cloud.google.com/container-engine\) , or the [Getting Started Guides]\(http://kubernetes.io/docs/getting-started-guides/).
